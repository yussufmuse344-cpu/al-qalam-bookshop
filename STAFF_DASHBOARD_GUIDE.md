## How Sales are Matched to Staff

The dashboard filters sales based on the `sold_by` field in the sales record:

1. **For Regular Staff**: Matches sales where `sold_by` contains your email username

   - Example: If logged in as `khaled@example.com`, shows sales where `sold_by` includes "khaled"

2. **For Admin/Yussuf**: Shows sales where `sold_by` includes "yussuf" or matches admin identifier

## Navigation

Access the Staff Dashboard via:

- Sidebar menu: **"My Sales"** (with TrendingUp icon)
- Located second in the navigation list

## Troubleshooting

### "All fields show 0"

**Possible causes:**

1. No sales recorded with your name in the `sold_by` field
2. Sales were recorded with a different name/spelling
3. Check console for debug logs showing:
   - Your staff identifier
   - Sample `sold_by` values from sales
   - Number of filtered sales

**How to check:**

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Look for console logs: `üîç Staff Dashboard Debug:`
3. Verify your sales have matching `sold_by` values

**Fix:**

- Ensure sales are recorded with your correct name/identifier
- Sales must have the `sold_by` field populated
- Name must match your email username (before @)
