Lenzro ERP ("we", "our", "us") is a business management application used by Hassan Muse BookShop & Cyber Café. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the application and related services.

## 1. Information We Collect
- Account information (name, email) when you sign in
- Business data you enter (inventory, sales, orders, expenses)

- Optional error monitoring/analytics (if enabled)

These providers process data on our behalf under their own security policies.
