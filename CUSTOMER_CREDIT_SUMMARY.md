## 🔒 Safety Features

### What Makes This Script Safe:

1. **IF NOT EXISTS** - Creates tables only if they don't exist

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer_credits ...
   ```

2. **OR REPLACE** - Updates functions/views without breaking

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_customer_credit_summary ...
   ```

3. **DROP IF EXISTS (only for policies)** - Safe because policies are recreated

   ```sql
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "..." ON customer_credits;
   CREATE POLICY "..." ON customer_credits ...
   ```

4. **No DROP TABLE** - Never deletes tables
5. **No DELETE commands** - Never removes data
6. **No ALTER breaking changes** - Doesn't modify existing tables
7. **Commented test data** - Test data is optional, you enable it
